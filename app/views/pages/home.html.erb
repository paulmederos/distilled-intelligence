						<p>Since the 2011 DI, Peer2Peer Tutors was aquired to expand by Aristotle Circle (<a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2012/02/02/peer2peer-tutors-acquired-to-expand.html">WBJ</a> | <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204652904577193470826876662.html">WSJ</a>). Peer2Peer founder, Erik Kimel, is now the Chief Strategy Officer of the company and overseeing a rapid expansion into domestic and international markets. D.I. was a stepping stone for thinking more broadly about how to scale, with whom to scale with, and how to make it happen in the most effective way.</p>

						<img width="200px" height="70px" src="assets/marz-logo-400x70.png">
						<p>Since its selection as the winner of Distilled Intelligence 1.0 in October, 2011, Marz has significantly progressed its product development efforts and has completed extensive in-house testing of a full size, installable unit.  Marz is poised to commence over-the-road testing of its "Ranger" Fuel Efficiency System in the third quarter of 2012.  In November, 2011 Marz was selected as one of ten "Greater Richmond Companies to Watch" by the Richmond Venture Forum.</p>

						<img width="200px" height="70px" src="assets/troopswap-logo-400x70.png">
						<p>DI gave us a platform to showcase the milestones we had achieved in front of a room full of early stage investors. Our participation netted us a giant check for second place (awesome!) and directly helped us close over 2.5M in equity financing over the next 60 days. Unless you have invented an application that prints money and clones amazing developers, you need to be at DI to engage with the community! </p>

						<img width="200px" height="70px" src="assets/shopsy-logo-400x70.png">
						<p>In the year since DI 1.0, Shopsy has participated in TechStars Boston, refocused our business on a B2B model that will be the focus of our new site when we relaunch in the next few weeks with new branding, UX and functionality, and we now have retailers in our pipeline like Macy’s, Beall’s, Bon Ton, and Oscar de la Renta.</p>
